# Boostrap

Congrats on setting up your new mac! Just try to execute the following commands:

```
git clone git@github.com:danilo-barboza/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
./bootstrap
```

Cool, the basic is configured. Now install the apps:

```
./install-apps.sh
```

# TODO
* Automatically install Solarized Dark theme in iTerm2 (https://github.com/altercation/solarized/tree/master/iterm2-colors-solarized)
